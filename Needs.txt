 Vendor Identification:
Start by identifying the GPU vendor, such as NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel, through system information or GPU driver APIs. Each vendor has its own GPU architectures and programming models, which will influence the specific steps needed for communication and programming.

Query GPU Information:
Retrieve detailed information about the GPU model, capabilities, supported features, and ISA through GPU driver APIs or system utilities. This data can help determine the GPU's architecture, instruction set, and memory layout, which are crucial for writing efficient machine code.

Capability Check:
Perform a capability check to determine the available features, hardware acceleration support, and compatibility with specific GPU instructions or extensions. This step ensures that the machine code you write can efficiently utilize the GPU's capabilities without errors or performance bottlenecks.

Adapt Code Generation:
Based on the detected GPU architecture and ISA, adapt the code generation process to write machine code that aligns with the GPU's instruction set and memory layout. This may involve using specific instructions, memory access patterns, and optimizations tailored to the detected GPU architecture.

Test and Verification:
Thoroughly test and verify the generated machine code on the detected GPU to ensure correct functionality and performance. Validate the output, graphics rendering, and communication with the GPU to confirm that the code executes as expected on the identified architecture.

By detecting the GPU architecture and ISA before writing machine code to the GPU using the CPU's bus, you can tailor your graphics programming approach to the specific hardware, maximizing performance and compatibility while minimizing potential issues related to GPU architecture differences.
